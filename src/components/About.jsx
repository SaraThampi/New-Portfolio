                In a team of six, we collaborated on a coding project for 4 weeks. I work in a homeless shelter and my teammates wanted to do something meaningful and asked me how they could help. I explained about my frustrations. Even though we do some amazing work with limited resources, we could be so much more efficient. I told them about the challenges of sharing data about the service users and how it lead to work being repeated or not being done at all. We all agreed this was a problem we needed to tackle. We surveyed homeless support workers from three different organisations and developed an app to help with their problems. We even had a session with a homeless shelter manager (not my manager!), who tried our app for himself  and gave us really encouraging feedback.
