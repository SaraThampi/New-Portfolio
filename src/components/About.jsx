            <p>Hi, My name is Sara Thampi and I have just completed an intensive coding bootcamp. In a team of six, we collaborated on a project for 4 weeks. I work in a homeless shelter and my teammates wanted to do something meaningful and asked me how they could help. I explained about my frustrations. Even though amazing work is done, we could be so much more efficient. I told them about the challenges of sharing data about the service users and how it lead to work being repeated and not done at all. We surveyed homeless support workers from three different organisations and developed an app to help with their problems. We even had a guided session with a homeless shelter manager (not my manager!) and he gave us good feedback.</p>
